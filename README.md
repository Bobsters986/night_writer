# Night_Writer Project
## night_writer.rb and night_reader.rb act as "runner" files. They instantiate a new instance of each type of translator respectively, then take the file arguments to be translated to new files.
## run them using ruby ./lib/night_writer.rb or ruby ./lib/night_reader.rb as their file paths along with the message file and file to be created
